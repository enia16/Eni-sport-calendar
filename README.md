# Eni-sport-calendar
A responsive web app for viewing and managing sports events.

Overview
An interactive calendar created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; it displays events per month, with options to create new events live.

Features
- Monthly calendar view with navigation
- Click events to see full details
- Add new events using the form.
- Fully responsive: mobile, tablet, desktop
- Modern UI with smooth animations

 How to Run
**Easiest Method:**

1. Double-click `index.html`
2. Opens in your browser automatically

## Usage
- **Navigate months**: Use ← → arrows
- **View details**: Click any event marker

- **Add event**: Click "Add Event" button, fill form, submit
Technical Decisions
**Why Vanilla JavaScript?

- No compilation utilities required
- Faster load times
- Demonstrates core JS skills

**Responsive Design
CSS Grid for calendar (7 columns)
- Flexbox for navigation

- Media queries at 768px and 480px

Date Handling

- Native JavaScript `Date` object
- Format: YYYY-MM-DD
- No external libraries needed
Assumptions

- Modern browser support: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

- Events do not have to persist between sessions
- Single timezone, no conversion is needed
- Basic validation will suffice
Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would add:

1. **Edit/Delete** - Manage existing events

2. **Better validation**: prevent duplicates, check conflicts
3. **Search/Filter** - Quickly find events

4. **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
