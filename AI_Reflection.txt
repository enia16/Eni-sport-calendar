AI REFLECTION DOCUMENT
Sports Event Calendar Project


OVERVIEW
I built this calendar app mostly myself using vanilla JavaScript. 
I used AI only for help with calendar date calculations 
and a few CSS layout suggestions.




WHAT I DID MYSELF 


- Entire project structure and planning
- All navigation and view switching logic
- Form validation and event adding functionality  
- Event detail display
- All button click handlers and interactions
- Mobile responsive design decisions
- Color scheme and UI design (purple gradient)
- All testing and debugging
- Chose to use vanilla JS instead of frameworks


Basically: The app logic, user interactions, and design are all mine.




WHERE I USED AI 




1. CALENDAR GRID MATH
   Problem: Calculating which day of the week a month starts
   
   AI Helped: Showed me firstDay.getDay() method and empty cell logic
   
   What I Did: 
   - Tested it with different months to understand how it works
   - Modified it to add my own styling and today highlighting
   - Now I understand: get day 0-6, add that many empty cells, 
     then loop through the days
   
   I can explain and rewrite this myself now.


2. DATE FORMATTING
   Problem: Converting dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
   
   AI Helped: Showed me padStart() for zero-padding
   
   What I Did:
   - Learned that months are 0-indexed (need +1)
   - Used this knowledge in other parts of my code
   - Wrote all the date comparison logic myself


3. CSS GRID STRUCTURE  
   Problem: Best way to make 7-column calendar layout
   
   AI Helped: Suggested grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr)
   
   What I Did:
   - Adjusted all spacing, colors, and sizing myself
   - Added hover effects and animations myself
   - Chose breakpoints based on my own testing




TECHNICAL DECISIONS


WHY VANILLA JAVASCRIPT?
- No build tools needed
- Demonstrates core JS understanding  
- Fast and simple for this scope


WHY SEPARATE FILES?
- Cleaner organization
- Real-world best practice


WHY CSS GRID?
- Perfect for calendar's 7-column layout
- Built-in responsive features


ONE IMPROVEMENT WITH MORE TIME


 EDIT/DELETE EVENTS
What I'd Add:
1. Edit button on event details
2. Delete button with confirmation  


Why: Makes app actually useful (data persists)


Time Needed: 2-3 hours


Code I'd Add:
```javascript


function loadEvents() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('events');
    return saved ? JSON.parse(saved) : sampleEvents;
}
```


Simple to implement - just wasn't in requirements.




WHAT I LEARNED


- Calendar algorithms and date math
- CSS Grid for complex layouts
- State management patterns
- How to work effectively with AI as a tool


AI helped me learn faster on tricky parts, but I wrote and 
understand all the code.
